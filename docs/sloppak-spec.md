# Sloppak / feedpak Format — moved

The full format specification that used to live here has moved to its own repository and is now
the **authoritative, versioned reference**:

> **📖 https://github.com/got-feedback/feedback-feedpak-spec**
> — normative spec ([`spec/feedpak-v1.md`](https://github.com/got-feedback/feedback-feedpak-spec/blob/main/spec/feedpak-v1.md)),
> JSON Schemas, examples, and a reference validator.

Update bookmarks to point there. This page is a thin pointer kept at the original path so existing
links keep resolving.

## Naming: `sloppak` here, `feedpak` in the spec

The published format is named **feedpak** (extension `.feedpak`, manifest key `feedpak_version`).
This codebase still uses the legacy **sloppak** name internally — `lib/sloppak.py`, the
`.sloppak` extension, `SLOPSMITH_*` env vars, etc. **They describe the same on-disk format.** The
rename is repo/public-facing only for now (see the top-level workspace `CLAUDE.md`), so when the
spec says `feedpak` / `feedpak_version`, the packs this server reads and writes today are the same
structure under the `.sloppak` name. The internal rename is a separate, later effort.

## Hand-editing a pack

For the practical "how do I edit my own pack" walkthrough (record your own stem, fix metadata,
swap cover art, replace a stem split), see the companion guide that stays in this repo:
[sloppak-hand-editing.md](sloppak-hand-editing.md).

## Where the format maps to code (this repo)

The spec is implementation-independent; this table is the feedback-specific bridge from format
concepts to the code that reads and writes them. It is **not** part of the format.
