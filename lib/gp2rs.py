       ``.direction``) — outermost; can teleport the cursor to a Segno,
       Coda, or song start, and arm an "al Fine" / "al Coda" stop or
       redirect that fires on the next pass. Checked after every emitted
       measure, including measures inside a repeat bracket.
    2. **Repeat brackets** (``isRepeatOpen`` / ``repeatClose`` with the
       ``repeatAlternative`` volta bitmask) — when an open is encountered
       the walker remembers (open, close, passes) and, after each emitted
       measure inside the block, decides whether to loop back to the open
       for the next pass.
    3. **Linear walk** — fall-through; emit one entry per measure.

    Conventionally, repeat brackets in a section that has been *jumped
    back to* via D.S./D.C. play **once** ("second time, don't repeat").
    We implement that by gating layer 2 on ``not jumped_back``.

    Malformed inputs (orphan opens, unresolved D.S. targets, etc.) emit
    a warning and fall through to a linear walk for the affected section.

    Setting ``expand_repeats=False`` produces a one-entry-per-measure

    the same chart the converter produced before this feature existed.

    Velocity is preserved verbatim (pyguitarpro uses MIDI 1-127). Ghost notes
    are surfaced as `g: true` (not as a velocity penalty), flams as `f: true`
    via `NoteEffect.isGrace`. Hi-hat openness is derived from the MIDI note
    number (42 closed / 46 open / 44 pedal) since GP stores those on distinct
    drum strings. Unknown percussion sounds (cowbell, tambourine etc.) are
    skipped — round-tripping them would require teaching `lib/drums.py` first.
    Callers can pass an empty dict as ``out_unmapped`` to receive a per-MIDI
    record of every skipped note (``{midi: {"count": int, "times": [...]}}``,
    times capped at 100 samples per note) so they can surface a warning or
    offer a manual mapping UI.

    Honours GP repeat brackets and D.S./D.C./Coda/Fine jumps when
    ``expand_repeats`` is true — same `_build_playback_schedule` machinery
    used by the guitar/bass/keys/legacy-drum-XML converters above.
