"""Session-sync relay WebSocket — /ws/sync/{session_id} (feedBack#1030).

A deliberately dumb fan-out room: a JSON text frame received from one client
is forwarded verbatim to every OTHER client connected to the same session id.
The server interprets nothing beyond the limits below — message schemas are
owned entirely by consumers. First consumer: splitscreen's LAN follower mode
(feedBack-plugin-splitscreen#21), which relays playhead/playstate/song-change
frames from a host window to view-only followers on other LAN devices.

Design points (full spec in the issue):

- Rooms are created on first join and garbage-collected when the last socket
  leaves. No history, no replay, no persistence — a late joiner simply waits
  for the next frame. Consumers that need state on join re-send it themselves
  (splitscreen answers every follower ``hello`` with a fresh ``config``).
- That statelessness is what makes consumer crash-recovery work: a host that
  relaunches and rejoins the same session id resumes publishing to its
  reconnecting subscribers with no server-side coordination, and an idle room
  is indistinguishable from a nonexistent one.
- ``session_id`` is client-generated and opaque (``[A-Za-z0-9_-]{4,64}``);
  consumers pick their own id policy (splitscreen uses a short typeable,
  persistent room key).
- DoS hygiene for a port that may be LAN-exposed: frame-size cap, per-room and
  total-room caps, and a per-socket inbound token-bucket rate cap. Over-limit
  sockets are closed with a policy code; the room carries on. A peer that dies
  mid-fan-out is dropped without wedging delivery to the rest.
