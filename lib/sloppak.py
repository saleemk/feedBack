"""Sloppak — open song format loader.

A `.sloppak` is an open, hand-editable song package. It exists in two
interchangeable forms:

1. **Zip archive** — a `.sloppak` file containing a `manifest.yaml`,
   arrangement JSONs, stem OGGs, optional cover/lyrics. Distribution form.
2. **Directory** — a directory whose name ends in `.sloppak/` containing the
   same files. Authoring form.

See the format spec in the project's sloppak plan for the full layout.
