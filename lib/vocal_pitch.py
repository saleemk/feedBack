"""Per-syllable vocal pitch extraction via the demucs server's /pitch endpoint.

Sibling to `lyrics_transcribe.py` on the karaoke side: once we have
isolated vocals + per-syllable lyric timing (both produced by the
WhisperX fallback or shipped in the source archive), the /pitch endpoint
runs CREPE over the vocals stem and returns one MIDI note per supplied
timing token. The result lands in `<sloppak>/vocal_pitch.json` in the
shape the byrongamatos/slopsmith-plugin-lyrics-karaoke renderer
already consumes:

    {"version": 1, "notes": [{"t": float, "d": float, "midi": int}, ...]}

Pre-generating during sloppak conversion means the karaoke plugin no
longer has to run pYIN locally on every first-play — the file is
already there.

Engine selection
────────────────
This module exposes only the remote path (`extract_pitch_remote`). The
demucs server's /pitch endpoint runs CREPE on a GPU when available,
which is materially better than the pYIN fallback the karaoke plugin
runs locally. Adding a local CREPE path here would mean pulling
`crepe` + `tensorflow` as plugin deps (~500 MB+ on top of the
existing torch/demucs/whisperx). Deferred until users hit the gap.
If you need a local fallback today, install
`byrongamatos/slopsmith-plugin-lyrics-karaoke` and let its local
pYIN run when the server isn't reachable.

Cache key parity with stem_separation / lyric_transcription
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A `pitch_extraction` manifest block mirrors the shape introduced by
slopsmith#357: `{engine, model, version}`. Today engine is fixed at
`"crepe"` (the server's choice) and model at `"v1"` (server doesn't
yet expose the CREPE capacity dial it uses internally; this is the
requested value, same caveat as `lyric_transcription.model`). The
schema version is independent of the upstream CREPE version and bumps
per slopsmith's contract:
   * patch — metadata-only or implementation fixes
   * minor — backward-compatible additions
   * major — output shape / semantics changed; existing
            vocal_pitch.json should be regenerated and remote caches
            should miss

    """POST the vocal stem + lyric timings to `{server_url}/pitch`.

    `lyrics` is the same `[{t, d, w}, ...]` list slopsmith writes to
    `lyrics.json`. The endpoint only consumes `t` + `d` (it doesn't
    need the word text), but we pass the full payload through —
    slimmer to forward what we already have than to project.

    Returns a normalized `notes` list: each entry is
    `{"t": float, "d": float, "midi": int}` with `t`/`d` rounded to 3
    decimals and `midi` coerced to int. Malformed server entries
    (missing key, non-numeric, wrong type) are skipped rather than
    propagated. Tokens the server couldn't extract a pitch for
    (silent, sub-threshold confidence, no neighbour to borrow from)
    are omitted from the response — the output may be shorter than
    the input lyrics.

    Errors raise `RuntimeError` with a truncated server response so
    the caller can log+continue without bringing down the surrounding
    transcription / split job. Transport-level failures
    (`requests.RequestException`: connection, DNS, timeout, upload
    aborted) are wrapped here so callers see one exception type, not
    requests' hierarchy. Matches the failure idiom in
    `transcribe_vocals_remote` and `_run_demucs_remote`."""
