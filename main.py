"""Programmatic entry point for the FeedBack server.

Using ``uvicorn.run()`` with ``log_config=None`` prevents uvicorn from calling
``logging.config.dictConfig(LOGGING_CONFIG)`` during its startup sequence.
This ensures that the structlog pipeline installed by ``configure_logging()``
is active for **all** uvicorn messages, including the earliest lifecycle lines
logged before the ASGI startup hook fires, such as:

    "Started server process [PID]"
    "Waiting for application startup"

Usage::

    python main.py              # default host 0.0.0.0, port 8000
    HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8001 python main.py
"""

def run() -> None:
    """Configure logging and start the uvicorn server.

    ``configure_logging()`` is called first so that when uvicorn starts with
    ``log_config=None`` it finds the structlog handlers already installed.
    Uvicorn will not call its own ``dictConfig()``, so those handlers are never
    overwritten and every log record passes through the same structured
    pipeline.
