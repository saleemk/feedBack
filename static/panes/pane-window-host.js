/*
 * fee[dB]ack — the pop-out window host.
 *
 * Opens a real OS window and MOVES THE PANE'S ELEMENT INTO IT.
 *
 * The move is the whole trick, and it works because the pane window is same-origin
 * and opener-linked: `document.adoptNode()` re-parents a live node into another
 * window's document, and an adopted node keeps its event listeners, its closures,
 * and every reference anything else holds to it. So the plugin's panel goes on
 * running the plugin's own code in the plugin's own realm — it is just being
 * *displayed* somewhere else. It looks and behaves exactly like what was popped
 * out, because it is exactly what was popped out.
 *
 * That is why this file must use `window.open()` and not ask the desktop's main
 * process to make a BrowserWindow: a window we didn't open gives us no handle to
 * its document, and without the handle there is nothing to adopt into. Electron
 * turns this same-origin `window.open()` into a real BrowserWindow anyway (see
 * main.ts's setWindowOpenHandler → `action: 'allow'`), and the main process
 * recognises it by its frame name and gives it remembered bounds, always-on-top
 * and the system tray. We get the OS window AND the DOM link.
 *
 * Styles come across too — the pane document starts empty, so we copy the app's
 * stylesheets into it. Without that the panel would land unstyled, which is the
 * one thing a "pop out exactly this" feature cannot do.
