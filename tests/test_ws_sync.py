"""Tests for the session-sync relay WebSocket (/ws/sync/{session_id}).

Behavior tests run against a minimal FastAPI app carrying just the router
(fast — no full-server import); one integration test imports the real server
to pin that the route is actually mounted there.

Covers the feedBack#1030 acceptance list: bidirectional fan-out, late join,
sender never echoed, room garbage collection, and the limit closes (invalid
session id, binary frames, frame size, room size, room count, rate cap) —
including that one client tripping a limit doesn't disturb the others.
